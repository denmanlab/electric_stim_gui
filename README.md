### This will be a quick guide on how to use all the different tools developed for the BRAINSBoard, STG5 and more!
![Top of the Board](images/BRAINSBoard_Side_Profile.png)
These are both useful tools used in conjunction with one another to easily allow for multi-channel stimulation of the NeuroNexus A1x16 16-Channel Electrode.

# BRAINSBoard:
## Purpose

The BRAINSBoard is a proprietary custom PCB that is designed to electronically switch between Cathode, Anode, Ground, and Floating states for 16 different electrode channels without physically interacting with the components during experiments. This enables:
- Stimulation at different loci in patterns.
- Grounding of every inactive pin to prevent noise.
- Use with a GUI designed for efficient pin switching during and between experiments.

# GUI

There are various sets of code designed to interface with the BRAINS Board through either the Arduino or Raspberry Pi.
These are guides on how they are designed as well as a simple measure as to how they may be manipulated for various uses.

## Part 1: Using Serial Communication with Arduino to Map Channels:

The current BRAINS Board API is built around Serial Inputs that are translated into pin activation using the [Brainsboard Serial Program Arduino Code](brainsboard_serial_pgm.ino)

This is also all right now designed to be used alongside an Arduino Micro Pro with the pinout drawn above, though it can easily be changed to work with any Arduino board and pinout using the #define functions.

The following pins correspond to channels above:
| Electrode Channel |    Arduino Pins     |
|:-----------------:|:-------------------:|
| Channel **1**     | Pin 16 + 1 + 5 + 6  |
| Channel **2**     | Pin 16 + 1 + 7 + 8  |
| Channel **3**     | Pin 16 + 1 + 9 + 10 |
| Channel **4**     | Pin 16 + 1 + 14 + 15|
| Channel **5**     | Pin 16 + 2 + 5 + 6  |
| Channel **6**     | Pin 16 + 2 + 7 + 8  |
| Channel **7**     | Pin 16 + 2 + 9 + 10 |
| Channel **8**     | Pin 16 + 2 + 14 + 15|
| Channel **9**     | Pin 16 + 3 + 5 + 6  |
| Channel **10**    | Pin 16 + 3 + 7 + 8  |
| Channel **11**    | Pin 16 + 3 + 9 + 10 |
| Channel **12**    | Pin 16 + 3 + 14 + 15|
| Channel **13**    | Pin 16 + 4 + 5 + 6  |
| Channel **14**    | Pin 16 + 4 + 7 + 8  |
| Channel **15**    | Pin 16 + 4 + 9 + 10 |
| Channel **16**    | Pin 16 + 4 + 14 + 15|

**The logic is this way because of the following:**

- Our **Output Enable** pin, that is connected to all 4 of the Octal Latches, is connected to **Arduino Pin 16**
- We have 4 **Latch Enable** pins that are used to determine which latch we are controlling
  - **Pin 1** is connected to the first **OCTAL LATCH**, which controls signals sent to the **SP3T** switches that set channel configuration for **Electrode Channels 1-4**
  - **Pin 2** is connected to the second **OCTAL LATCH**, which controls signals sent to the **SP3T** switches that set channel configuration for **Electrode Channels 5-8**
  - **Pin 3** is connected to the third **OCTAL LATCH**, which controls signals sent to the **SP3T** switches that set channel configuration for **Electrode Channels 9-12**
  - **Pin 4** is connected to the fourth **OCTAL LATCH**, which controls signals sent to the **SP3T** switches that set channel configuration for **Electrode Channels 13-16**
- We then have **8 Data Input** pins connected to all of the **Octal Latches**, which will change the state of the digital output of the latches to High or Low dependent on a) if the latch enable for said Octal Latch is on and b) if the Arduino pin connected to each digital input pin is high or low
  - **Pins 5 and 6** control the output to the **SP3T** controlling **Electrode Channels 1, 5, 9, and 13**.
  - **Pins 7 and 8** control the output to the **SP3T** controlling **Electrode Channels 2, 6, 10, and 14**.
  - **Pins 9 and 10** control the output to the **SP3T** controlling **Electrode Channels 3, 7, 11, and 15**.
  - **Pins 14 and 15** control the output to the **SP3T** controlling **Electrode Channels 4, 8, 12, and 16**.

**Important Note:** The **A0 pin** is used as an input of any External Triggers from any other device (ie. a stimulator) for the board to use as an input to switch channels, if required.

The code also has 4 states that any channel can be set to at any given moment: **FLOATING**, **CATHODE**, **ANODE**, and **SIGNAL GROUND**. The board is designed to allow the **OCTAL LATCH** to send 2 outputs to any given **SP3T** correlated to a specific electrode channel, and logic of the switch by the **SP3T** is treated as follows:
| INPUT 1 STATE | INPUT 2 STATE | CHANNEL CONNECTED |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-----------------:|
| **LOW**       | **LOW**       | **FLOATING**      |
| **HIGH**      | **LOW**       | **CATHODE**       |
| **LOW**       | **HIGH**      | **ANODE**         |
| **HIGH**      | **HIGH**      | **SIGNAL GROUND** |

**Important Note:** The **SIGNAL GROUND** is connecting any signal connected to the $\textbf{\color{green}Green Banana Connector}$, which should ideally connected to the same **Reference Ground** that you would use for any electrophysiology or stimulation experiment.

### Serial Communication Logic:
**The following is a step-by-step guide for utilizing any serial communication to control the channel outputs at any given time**
1. Ensure you are using 115200 bps as the data rate for for Serial line
2. '[' Begins reading channel Data
3. **'{X1}'** is a *Hexadecimal Number*
    - **To Set Channels 1-10:** X1 corresponds to a numerical value Channel # - 1 (ie. Channel 1 is 0, Channel 2 is 1, ..., Channel 10 is 9)
    - **To Set Channels 11-16:** X1 corresponds to an alphabtical value between A-F (ie. Channel 11 is A, Channel 12 is B, ..., Channel 16 is F)
4. **'{X2}'** is a *Character*
      - **F** for **FLOATING**
      - **C** for **CATHODE**
      - **A** for **ANODE**
      - **G** for **SIGNAL GROUND**
5. **']'** Closes *Reading Channel States* and *"Applies"* the channel states by utilizing logic to change where channels are connected
6. **'x'** Sets a *wait* until the **External Trigger Pin** recieves a signal (and won't continue until that trigger is low to change anything)
7. **'{t}{u}'** Sets a *wait* for a set time
      - **'{t}'** is a *numerical value* that is read and stored until the serial code reads a non-numerical value
      - **'{u}'** is a *character* that is written after the numerical values have been written that determines the units of delay time
        - **s** will set the *time {t}* to seconds
        - **m** will set the *time {t}* to milliseconds
        - **u** will set the *time {t}* to microseconds
8. **'l{c}'** Sets up a *loop* for the inputted channel setups for *{c}* more counts
      - If *{c}* is not set, it will infinitely loop.
9. **Important Note:** It is not necessary to write out every channel, previous channel states are already stored and latched until that specific channel is changed
#### Example Serial Command:
**[0F1F2F3F4F5F6F7F8F9FAFBFCFDFEFFF]200u[0C1A]x[0G1GEAFC]2sl3**
- This will first **set every channel** to **FLOATING**
- It will then **wait 200 microseconds**
- It will then change **Channel 1** to **CATHODE** and **Channel 2** to **ANODE**
- It will then **wait** until it recieves the **External Trigger** at **Pin A0**
- It will then change **Channel 1** and **Channel 2** to **SIGNAL GROUND** and **Channel 15** to **ANODE** and **Channel 16** to **CATHODE**
- It will then **wait 2 seconds**
- It then reads **l3**, so it will **loop** the previous steps **3 more times**
